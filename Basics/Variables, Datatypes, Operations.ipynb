    "my_first_variable (see below) is a variable, a reserved spot in the computer memory that can be used to store some type of data. The amount of memory allocated per variable is decided by the interpreter, and in Python is defined by the type of data we assign to the variable. When we create a variable, the name of the variable, \"a\", goes on the left side of the equals sign and the data we want it to store goes on the right. If we were the Python interpreter, behind the scenes we would do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Look at the right hand side of the =, get the user input, and observe that it is an integer.\n",
    "    2) Block off a certain chunk of memory for an integer.\n",
    "    3) Fill the data on the right-hand side of the = into the memory.\n",
    "    4) Create a variable \"a\" referencing this portion of the memory. \"a\" is called a reference.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In Python, the two basic types of data we can assign to variables are numbers and strings. Subtypes of numbers include integers, longs, and floats, while all strings are just assortments of characters. The comments above each variable definition below indicates what the respective datatype is used for. Note how in Python, you don't need to explicitly give the interpreter the type of data a certain variable points to. Rather, the interpreter assumes the datatype based on what's given."
