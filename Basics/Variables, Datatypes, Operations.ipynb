    "my_first_variable (see below) is a variable, a reserved spot in the computer memory that can be used to store some type of data. The amount of memory allocated per variable is decided by the interpreter, and in Python is defined by the type of data we assign to the variable. When we create a variable, the name of the variable, \"a\", goes on the left side of the equals sign and the data we want it to store goes on the right. If we were the Python interpreter, behind the scenes we would do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Look at the right hand side of the =, get the user input, and observe that it is an integer.\n",

    "    3) Fill the data on the right-hand side of the = into the memory.\n",

Subtypes of numbers include integers, longs, and floats, while all strings are just assortments of characters. The comments above each variable definition below indicates what the respective datatype is used for. Note how in Python, you don't need to explicitly give the interpreter the type of data a certain variable points to. Rather, the interpreter assumes the datatype based on what's given."

The operations it performs are based off of a table of commands and the only allowable operations are to move the reader head along the spool of memory and to modify the memory. Surprisingly, from these basic operations Turing proved the endless possibilities of a computer program (search Turing Machines on Wikipedia for more info). Today, nearly all programming languages are Turing Complete, meaning that they can do any tasks a Turing machine, and by extension, a computer can do.\n",

    "What this shows is the immense power of computer programming languages. They have to operate at the level of both basic bits in addition to being usable for large-scale industrial applications for things so complex as mapping and facial recognition. If you have extra time and enjoy learning this type of stuff, you should definitely try looking at Compilers and the Assembly programming language, low-level interfaces to go even closer to the fundamental hardware."
