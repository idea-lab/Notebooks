Sometimes, however, these datatypes are not sufficient to represent a real world object. That's where classes come in. We can make a class to represent an Animal or a Dog or a Cat that contains data (height, weight, age, color, breed, etc.) and methods (walk, run, meow/bark, eat, etc.) These data types can be _instantiated_ to create objects. For instance, we can instantiate the Dog class to create your personal dog, stored in a variable. "
