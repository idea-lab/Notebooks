For instance, a car could be considered an object, and it has attributes (color, make, model, miles, etc.) and abilities (drive, park, turn off, etc.). In object-oriented programming, we represent real objects which contain data (aka attributes) and abilities (aka methods or functions)."

    "Classes are programmer defined data types. You have already seen the `int`, `str`, `float`, and `bool` datatypes. These are built into the Python language for you to use as you see fit. Sometimes, however, these datatypes are not sufficient to represent a real world object. That's where classes come in. We can make a class to represent an Animal or a Dog or a Cat that contains data (height, weight, age, color, breed, etc.) and methods (walk, run, meow/bark, eat, etc.) These data types can be _instantiated_ to create objects. For instance, we can instantiate the Dog class to create your personal dog, stored in a variable. "
