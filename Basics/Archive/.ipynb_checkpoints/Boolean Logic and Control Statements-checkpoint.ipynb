    "While we won't be going into **boolean algebra** here, we will be using **boolean** values extensively for decision making in our programs\n",
    "\n",
    "_Side Note_:\n",
    "This connection between True and False and computers intuitively makes sense, because True can be represented by a 1 and False by a 0. Since computers are just complex circuits which use electricity, 1's and 0's can easily be represented as either a flow of electricity or no electricity flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, boolean values are just another datatype we can store in a variable. The only boolean values in Python are `True` and `False`. Note that you do not need quotation marks, like you would for strings, because `True` and `False` are reserved keywords in Python."

The biggest first bite you can take is 25¢, the quarter. Note that by selecting a quarter first, you reduce the 36¢ problem down to an 11¢ problem, since 36¢ - 25¢ = 11¢. The remaining 11¢ is a much smaller version of the original problem. At this point, another 25¢ would be too big, so the next greediest bite size would be 10¢, the dime. Grabbing a dime leaves you with a 1¢ problem, at which point the largest bite would be 1¢, the penny.
