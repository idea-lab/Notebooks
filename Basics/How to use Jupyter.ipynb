    "## Installation\n",
    "We recommend installing jupyter through Anaconda, because Anaconda also comes with many other standard python libraries. (This should already be done for you on the school computers)\n",
    "* [Anaconda download](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running jupyter\n",
    "In your terminal application of choice, navigate to a working directory. \n",
    "    \n",
    "(Remember, ```cd``` to move into a folder, ```ls``` or ```dir``` to view the contents of your current directory)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Editing notebooks\n",
    "Opening a new or existing notebook brings you to the notebook user interface. This UI contains a menu and toolbar at the top and a notebook area below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks consist of cells, either of markdown (a text formatting language), or of a programming language (in this case, Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two modes of modifying a jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is edit mode, where you can simply edit the contents of a cell. The cell selection should be green, and you will also see a pencil in the top right corner. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second is command mode, where you modify each cell itself. Command mode is signified by a blue selection, and no pencil in the top right. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get from command mode to edit mode, simply press <kbd>enter</kbd>, or double click on a cell. You'll enter edit mode for the selected cell. To get from edit mode to command mode, press <kbd>esc</kbd> or use the mouse to click outside the cell's editor area.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keyboard Shortcuts (use them!!)\n",
    "You can view all keyboard shortcuts through the help menu, but these are some useful ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> - Run cell, and select next cell\n",
    "* <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> - Run cell, and stay on the same cell\n",
