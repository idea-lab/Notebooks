    "## Boolean Logic\n",
    "When we consider a statement such as \"Water is made up of two hydrogens and one oxygen,\" it can be evaluated as either true or false. In other terms, the statement is objective and the logic either makes sense or doesn't. In the 19th-century, mathematician George Boole thought of a form of algebra solely based of TRUE and FALSE logic. While we won't be going into **boolean algebra** here, note that using TRUE and FALSE is the foundation of all computer decision making. This connection between TRUE and FALSE and computers intuitively makes sense, because TRUE can be represented by a 1 and FALSE by a 0. Since computers are just complex circuits which use electricity, 1's and 0's can easily be represented as either a flow of electricity or no electricity flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, boolean logic is just another datatype we can store in a variable. To create a boolean variable, note that the only two options for data are \"True\" and \"False\". Unlike strings which are surrounding in \"\", these special words (note the capitalization) are reserved by Python and cannot be used anywhere else."

    "While evaluating statements with one point of logic is powerful, what would be even more powerful is if we could evaluate multiple statements at once. Using the English statement given above, let's say we wanted to evaluate \"Water is made up of two hydrogens and one oxygen, both fundamental elements\". We could split this complex statement up into two smaller sub-statements: 1) \"Water is made up of two hydrogens and one oxygen\" and 2) \"Hydrogen and oxygen are fundamental elements\". Thus, by breaking a large boolean statement into smaller ones, we can evaluate each of them separately, and compound the logic produced by each separate one to determine the overal statement validity.
