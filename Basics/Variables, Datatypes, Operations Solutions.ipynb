    "The outside int() converts whatever is inside the parentheses into an integer. In this case, we have input() inside the parentheses, which returns a string (remember, input() asks for user input and returns whatever the user typed as a string). The function int() takes in this string value and turns it into a number. When the program asks for user input, if I enter 3, the input() function gives us \"3\", a string. The int() function then takes the \"3\" returned by input() and turns it into 3, an integer. This process of converting from one datatype to another (like from string to integer) is called typecasting. If we use float() instead, the program would still work, and it would be able to take in user inputted numbers that have decimal places. This is because float() converts the string inputted by the user into a float, which is a number with decimal places. Numbers with decimal places can be squared, subtracted, and square rootted. "
