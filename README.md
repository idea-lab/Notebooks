# Notebooks
Order of notebooks:
1. How to Use Jupyter
2. Intro to CS
3. Variables, Datatypes, Operations
4. Boolean Logic and Control Statements
5. Lists, Tuples, and Functions

Note: Try to solve as many problems from the psets as possible, including the project at the end. Ask if you need any help understanding anything, want to brainstorm solution ideas, or need help with an error!

Fundamental computer science concepts are in the "basic" folder. Inside "basic," tutorials from past weeks are in the "archives" folder while solutions are in "solutions." The current week's lecture is directly in the "basic" directory.
